# Introduction To DataScience
### Instructor: Tirtharaj Dash

This repo will contain information or materials (mostly Python-related) for my course "Introduction to Data Science" that I am teaching as a part of WILP course structure at BITS Pilani, India.

The materials are structured lecture wise (L01, L02, ...). Under each directory (e.g. L01), there are files or programs stored for students' to play around. These programs are mostly during teaching and these are live demonstrations. You will see that many a times, these are not fully optimised. 

I believe in "beautiful" coding and the programs within these directories may not satisfy myself. These will be cleaned or optimised over time. This is the first time, I am developing this lab structure for this course and it would take some iterations to converge to a satisfactory optimum. Till then, enjoy and do please let me know at my [email](mailto:dashtirtharaj@acm.org).
